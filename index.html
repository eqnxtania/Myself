            <p> Isn't there more to life?<mark> What am I here to do?</mark> Your mission at work - and all of life - will become clear as you discover your role in God's incredible story. This 7-day reading plan will
                provide you a better understanding of God's command to Adam and Eve in Genesis 1, sometimes called the "cultural mandate," and how to apply it to your life. On each day, you will get a Bible
                reading and a brief devotional that will help you clarify your mission.</p>
