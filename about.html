            <b> <font color="blue">myself:</font></b>
            <p> I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing
                on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p>

            <b> <font color="blue">  friends:   </font>  </b>
            <p> Friendship means familiar and liking of each other's mind. People who are friends talk to each other and spend time together. They also help each other when they are in trouble or are hurt. Friends are people that can
                be looked up to and trusted.</p>
